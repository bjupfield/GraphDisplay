Okay the problem is how do I give information to my jpg creator?
how do I make this information dynamic so that it can create pathfinding-graphs?
the dumbest solution would be something like this...
"picture objects" which are just arrays with the rgb values in them
"graph object" which is just an array with details on the size of the graph and the picture objects that are on each point
so we create a graph object of say size 3x2 and the array holds picture objects labels, like [l1, l2, l2, l2, l1, l2]
where that array would mean that the first pixel is a picture object of label 1 and the next 3 are label 2 and so on, obviously
standard 1-d to 2-d array shenanigans
we would than send this graph object to the jpg encoder which would pull the data from the labels by searching for the picture objects
