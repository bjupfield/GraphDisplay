Okay the problem is how do I give information to my jpg creator?
how do I make this information dynamic so that it can create pathfinding-graphs?
the dumbest solution would be something like this...
"picture objects" which are just arrays with the rgb values in them
"graph object" which is just an array with details on the size of the graph and the picture objects that are on each point
so we create a graph object of say size 3x2 and the array holds picture objects labels, like [l1, l2, l2, l2, l1, l2]
where that array would mean that the first pixel is a picture object of label 1 and the next 3 are label 2 and so on, obviously
standard 1-d to 2-d array shenanigans
we would than send this graph object to the jpg encoder which would pull the data from the labels by searching for the picture objects


okay our next thing we need to do is change the huffmanTable::frequency function
to actual go through the mcu and count the huffman values that are in it, so it would do this
by something like counting until the next Coefficent thats non-zero than saving that count to the
first 4 bits and saving the coefficients bit length to the last four bits
we dont stop counting when the zeros are above a 15 count, we count untill the next coefficient
or the end of the mcu
this has to be done because F0 do not need to be implemented before a 00 so we can only tell if we
need an F0 if there is a coefficiet after it.
we should probably make a function that works for both writing to the file and creating the huffman tables
to be efficient
